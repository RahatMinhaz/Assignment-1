                <p>If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we’d all be much happier. However, unlike food based recipes, life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives their unique life. It means we must ‘cook’ with what we have and see what we can come up with it. Depending on our knowledge of our ingredients and the objective we wish to will establish how difficult it would be to ‘cook up’ our desired results.</p>
